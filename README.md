# Social-Network-API
 The Social Network API is a back-end application using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It lets users share thoughts, react to friends' posts, and manage a friend list. Built with NoSQL, it handles large unstructured data, offering routes for creating, updating, and deleting users, thoughts, and reactions.
